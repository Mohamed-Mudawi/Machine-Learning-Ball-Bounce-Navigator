# Machine-Learning-Bounce-Navigator

This project is a Python machine learning demonstration. Most of the project is displayed to the user through Python Turtle. The main idea of the project is a ball trying to find its way through user-created obstacles to reach the goal - marked in green. 

The first part of the program is the obstacle creation. In this stage, the user pressed up, down, left, or right arrows to draw obstacles, that the ball will have to learn to navigate through. The edges of the screen act as obstacles so that the ball will not go off-screen. 

Once the user is done creating the obstacles, the ball is animated and the ball goes straight towards the goal, assuming there are no obstacles. If the ball encounters an obstacle, it will bounce off of it and after a few seconds it will reset its position to start a new run. Now that it has information that there is an obstacle in its way, it will move a small amount left, right, up, or down before it hit that same obstacle (depending on the degree it hit the obstacle). For example, if the ball hit a horizontal surface at 315 degrees, the next run the ball will move a little right before it hits it again. If it hit a horizontal surface at 225 degrees, it will move a little left before it hits it. 

Of course, there won't only be single one-piece obstacles, and the user could try to create dead-ends or areas that would be difficult for the ball to navigate. In cases like these, the ball will "sniff" out the obstacles to try to find openings while also trying its best to go in a straight line to the goal. The way the ball sniffs out the obstacles includes various algorithms that almost always guarantee it to find an opening. One such algorithm is hugging certain obstacles, and not on others. This will allow the ball to find an opening in these obstacles, even if it's a small one. Another algorithm is going a different direction if the ball hit the same location. For example, if the ball hit a vertical obstacle and went up, if it hit the exact same location again, instead of going up it will go down to try to find an opening.
